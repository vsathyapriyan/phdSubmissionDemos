# SPEECH ENHANCEMENT USING BINARY ESTIMATOR SELECTION APPLIED TO HEARING AIDS WITH A REMOTE MICROPHONE

### Naming Convention

- **X** = *SNR at the HA microphone signals*
- **Y** = *TDOA assumed*
- **Z** = *Noisy Type in the HA microphone signals*

1. **Noisy_HA_X_Z.wav** - Noisy signal at the HA reference microphone.
2. **MWF_X_Z.wav** - MWF estimate using only the HA microphone signals.
3. **LP_Y_Z.wav** - LP estimate using the only the remote microphone signal.
4. **Prop_X_Y_Z.wav** - Proposed method estimate, using HA and remote microphone signals.

**Note: All the remote microphone signals in these examples are at an SNR = 30 dB iin WGN.**
